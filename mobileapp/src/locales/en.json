    "gluten_para":"Gluten is a composite protein naturally present in certain cereal grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. It plays a crucial role in food processing, particularly in the context of baking, as it provides elasticity and helps dough maintain its shape. Gluten consists of two main proteins, glutenin and gliadin, which, when combined with water, create a sticky, stretchy network. While it's responsible for the texture and structure of bread and other baked goods, it can also be problematic for individuals with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, as it triggers adverse reactions in their bodies when consumed.",
    "lactose_para":"Lactose is a description that refers to lactose, a natural sugar found in milk and dairy products, which can be digested without difficulty by individuals. In contrast to individuals with lactose intolerance, who have difficulty digesting lactose, people who are described as having easy lactose are typically able to digest lactose without experiencing digestive discomfort.",
    "eggs_para":"Eggs are versatile and nutritious food. They are a source of protein and healthy fats. They can be prepared in various ways, such as boiled, fried, scrambled, or poached, and are used in a variety of recipes, from omelets to cakes. Eggs are a staple in cooking and are valued for their flavor and their ability to bind ingredients in many culinary preparations",
