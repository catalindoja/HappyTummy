                                Sulfites are chemical substances used as additives in food and beverages. They are often added to preserve freshness and prevent food from spoiling. Sulfites can be found in products such as wines, dried fruits, juices, and canned goods. Some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to sulfites, which can cause adverse reactions. For this reason, foods containing sulfites are typically labeled to inform consumers of their presence.
