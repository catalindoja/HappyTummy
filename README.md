Happy Tummy is a social network style service dedicated to people with specific dietary needs arising from various food allergies. The main objective is to provide comprehensive information, valuable data and product recommendations from various supermarkets or small stores, all with the aim of helping users who suffer from food allergies or intolerances. Happy Tummy seeks to help people make informed shopping decisions by ensuring that they can easily locate and purchase products that are safe and suitable for their specific dietary needs.

On the platform, users can access essential product information such as detailed descriptions and an allergens list. This allows users to make informed choices based on their dietary needs. In addition, the community approach allows users to benefit from the collective wisdom of others. They can consult the comments and opinions of other community members to assess the quality and suitability of a product based on real-life experiences.

In addition, Happy Tummy offers a diverse selection of selected recipes, which serve as a source of inspiration and guidance for users who wish to incorporate the recommended products into their meals. This feature encourages cooking discovery and ensures that users can enjoy delicious and satisfying dishes that suit their dietary needs.

As a quick summary, the service consists of two platforms: a website adapted to official markets accounts, providing them with an easy-to-use interface for publishing verified products and recommended recipes, as well as engaging with customers and efficiently managing their accounts; at the same time, there is a mobile application designed for ordinary users, which allows them to conveniently access the wealth of information provided from virtually anywhere and at any time. They also have the ability to publish products from any supermarket and homemade recipes.
